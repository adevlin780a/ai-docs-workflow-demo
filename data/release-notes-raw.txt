## Notes (unedited)

Alex: Kicking off with sprint review — backend mostly on track but analytics API performance still lagging.  
Jordan: yeah, `/analytics/summary` endpoint slow again. DB queries not optimized. Maybe use caching or pre-aggregated tables.  
Sam: QA noticed 500 errors during load test. Could be tied to the same endpoint.  
Jordan: I’ll look into DB indexing + caching layer (Redis?).  

Priya: Frontend side: dashboard redesign 80% done, still needs color tweaks + dark mode support. Accessibility team flagged low contrast on some charts.  
Alex: Let’s make sure WCAG compliance is ready for release.  
Priya: OK, will finalize by next sprint.  

Morgan: Docs side — still a big backlog. Product updates not properly reflected in Confluence.  
Alex: Can AI help with that?  
Morgan: Yeah, I’ve been testing a script to summarize bug reports + meeting notes. It’s producing readable drafts, but still needs review for tone/accuracy.  
Sam: That would save a lot of time, especially for release notes.  
Alex: Cool, we’ll pilot it for this release cycle. Morgan to refine the process.

## Discussion: Bug Priorities
- 82 open issues in Jira → 30 minor, 20 UI-related, rest functional.  
- Decision: focus on performance bugs + API reliability first.  
- QA to triage by severity, not creation date.  
- Sam: “Can we mark repetitive UI bugs as backlog-only unless customer-facing?”  
- Alex: Agreed. Document criteria in QA Confluence space.

## Docs + Knowledge Base
Morgan: We need consistent format for release notes. Some teams write paragraphs, others bullet points.  
Alex: Standardize using the AI template outputs — concise summary, then sections for fixes, improvements, etc.  
Morgan: Done. I’ll update `summarize_docs.py` to include those section headers automatically.
