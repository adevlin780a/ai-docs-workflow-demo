# Raw Meeting Notes — Engineering Weekly Sync  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Attendees:** Alex (PM), Jordan (Backend), Priya (Frontend), Sam (QA), Morgan (Tech Writer)  
**Duration:** 45 min

## Notes (unedited transcript style)

- Alex opened with quick review of sprint 19. Backend tasks mostly done except caching layer.  
- Jordan: “analytics API still slow, especially `/stats/usage`. Seeing 30% increase in response times. We’re still hitting the DB too much.”  
- Sam: “Can we cache some of that data? Maybe Redis? We did that before for reporting.”  
- Jordan: “Yeah, Redis could cut load by 70%. I can set it up this week.”  
- Alex: “Cool, make it a priority item.”

### Documentation
- Morgan: Docs are out of sync with product updates. Release notes inconsistent across teams.  
- Alex: “We can’t keep rewriting manually every sprint. Maybe AI can help?”  
- Morgan: “I’ve been prototyping an AI summarization script — takes raw bug reports and meeting notes and outputs summaries. Early results look good.”  
- Alex: “Let’s test it for the next release. If it works, we’ll integrate it.”

### UI Updates
- Priya: Color palette still not finalized. QA flagged accessibility issues (contrast ratio).  
- Sam: “Hover states missing on dashboard widgets.”  
- Priya: “Yeah, I’ll fix the hover states and finalize color palette by next sprint.”  

---

### QA / Bug Backlog
- Sam: 80+ open bugs in Jira. A lot of minor UI stuff. We need to focus on critical ones.  
- Alex: “Let’s triage today. Critical bugs first — especially anything causing performance issues.”  
- Sam: “Got it, I’ll update Jira filters.”  

---

### General Discussion
- Jordan mentioned some inconsistent logging in `bulk_upload_service.py` but low priority.  
- Priya asked if product team can define a consistent “Done” definition for documentation tasks — currently different per team.  
- Alex: “Let’s align on that in next sprint retro.”

### Action Items (rough notes)
- Jordan → add Redis caching for analytics endpoints  
- Morgan → finish AI-assisted documentation workflow demo  
- Priya → finalize color palette + fix accessibility issues  
- Sam → update Jira filters + triage bugs  

---

### Next Steps
- Test caching implementation by next sprint.  
- Run AI documentation prototype on next set of bug reports + meeting notes.  
- Follow up on UI accessibility before release freeze.
