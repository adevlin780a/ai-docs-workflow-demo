# Raw Bug Reports — October 2025

## [JIRA-1421] App Crashes on File Upload
User: *@rmarquez*  
Date: Oct 10, 2025  

When uploading a CSV file around 500MB, the web app completely freezes. CPU usage spikes to 100% and browser tab crashes after about 20 seconds. Happens in both Chrome and Firefox. Smaller files seem fine.  
Error logs show “MemoryError: process out of memory.”  
Backend logs mention chunking error in `/upload_manager.py` line 114.

## [JIRA-1427] Dashboard Doesn’t Refresh Correctly
User: *@awei*  
Date: Oct 13, 2025  

After completing a task, dashboard still shows old progress until the page is hard-refreshed (Ctrl+Shift+R). It’s confusing for users because tasks look incomplete.  
The API call returns the right data, so probably a frontend cache or state update issue.  
Jordan thinks it’s related to missing timestamp invalidation.

## [JIRA-1433] Markdown Rendering Broken
User: *@teamdocs*  
Date: Oct 14, 2025  


Shows up as raw text instead of a formatted table.  
Started happening after last frontend build (v2.8.1). Possibly related to markdown-it update?

## [JIRA-1438] Scheduled Reports Running Early
User: *@sroberts*  
Date: Oct 15, 2025  

Daily reports are being sent one hour earlier than scheduled for EMEA users.  
Config says “8:00 AM local time” but logs show execution at 7:00.  
Looks like UTC offset issue — reports triggered by server time instead of user timezone setting.  
Impact: All customer reports going out at incorrect times.

## [JIRA-1440] API 500 Errors on Bulk Upload
User: *@qateam*  
Date: Oct 17, 2025  

During regression testing, bulk upload endpoint returned intermittent 500 errors.  
Stack trace points to missing exception handling in `bulk_upload_service.py`.  
Also observed that error messages are inconsistent — sometimes empty response body.  
Seems related to memory leak fix merged last week.

## [JIRA-1442] Minor UI Bugs
User: *@priyaa*  
Date: Oct 18, 2025  

- Text overflow in dashboard widgets when window < 1200px wide  
- Hover state missing for “View Details” button  
- Some colors don’t meet accessibility contrast ratio  
Nothing critical but should be cleaned up for the next release.

## [JIRA-1445] Authentication Timeout Errors
User: *@qa_automation*  
Date: Oct 20, 2025  

Login requests occasionally time out after 30s during automated testing.  
May be related to new session validation logic.  
Needs investigation — could be token refresh timing issue.

## [JIRA-1449] Search Results Delayed
User: *@support_team*  
Date: Oct 22, 2025  

Customers reporting slow search queries in analytics view.  
Response times up from 200ms to 1.5s.  
Possibly due to index refresh frequency or database load balancing after migration.  
Jordan suggested caching results temporarily until fix is deployed.
