# Release Notes — Version 1.0.0  
*Date: October 23, 2025*  
*Author: AI-Assisted Documentation Workflow Demo*

---

## New Features

### AI Summarization Workflow
- Added the AI-Assisted Documentation Workflow prototype that converts raw text (such as bug reports or meeting notes) into structured documentation.
- Introduced `summarize_docs.py`, a command-line tool that reads text files, summarizes them using an AI model, and outputs clean Markdown drafts.
- Provided example prompt templates for bug reports, meeting summaries, and release notes.

### Prompt Library
- Created a reusable prompt collection for multiple documentation scenarios:
  - Bug reports → Release notes  
  - Meeting notes → Team summaries  
  - Raw updates → Changelogs  

### AI Output Samples
- Added sample input/output pairs in `/data` and `/ai_outputs` to demonstrate the workflow:
  - `bug_reports_raw.txt` → `summarized_bug_reports.md`  
  - `meeting_notes_raw.txt` → `meeting_notes_summary.md`

---

## Improvements

- Standardized Markdown output for all generated summaries, including consistent headings, bullet lists, and timestamps.  
- Improved file naming conventions to include timestamps (e.g., `bug_reports_raw_summary_20251023-1045.md`).  
- Expanded documentation with detailed `README.md`, workflow diagrams, and supporting files under `/docs/`.

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed inconsistent formatting in Markdown tables and headers.  
- Resolved a minor encoding issue when reading input files with non-UTF8 characters.  
- Improved error handling and messages when input files are missing or unreadable.

## Future Roadmap

- Integrate with Confluence or Notion APIs for automated publishing of summaries.
