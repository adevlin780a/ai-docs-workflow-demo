## Fixed Issues

### 1. Application Crash on Large File Upload
**Issue:** Uploading files larger than 500MB caused the application to freeze and crash.  
**Cause:** Unhandled memory allocation during the file chunking process.  
**Resolution:** Implemented streamed file handling to process large uploads in smaller segments.  
**Impact:** Users can now upload large files without performance degradation or crashes.

### 2. Incorrect Status Display on Dashboard
**Issue:** Some completed tasks continued to appear as "In Progress" after refresh.  
**Cause:** API caching delay due to missing timestamp invalidation logic.  
**Resolution:** Updated the dashboard refresh logic to include cache-busting parameters.  
**Impact:** Status indicators now update correctly in real time after tasks complete.

### 3. Broken Markdown Rendering in Notes
**Issue:** Certain Markdown syntax (code blocks and tables) rendered incorrectly in meeting notes.  
**Cause:** Deprecated Markdown parser version in the frontend build.  
**Resolution:** Upgraded to the latest parser and adjusted CSS styles for table borders.  
**Impact:** Notes and documentation pages now display Markdown syntax correctly and consistently.

### 4. Inconsistent Time Zone Handling in Reports
**Issue:** Scheduled reports generated one hour early for users in UTC+1 time zones.

**Resolution:** Implemented dynamic time zone detection based on user settings.  
**Impact:** All automated reports are now generated at the correct local time.
