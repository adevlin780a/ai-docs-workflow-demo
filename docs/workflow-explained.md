# ðŸ§  Workflow Explained

This document describes how the AI-Assisted Documentation Workflow operates.

### 1. Data Collection
Raw text sources such as bug reports, meeting notes, or customer tickets are collected from internal systems (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Slack).

### 2. AI Summarization
An AI model (like GPT-4-Turbo) processes the text and produces a structured summary or draft documentation piece. The AI output is stored in `/ai_outputs`.

### 3. Human Review
A technical writer reviews the AI output for clarity, accuracy, and tone. Minor adjustments are made to align with company style guides.

### 4. Publication
The approved content can then be uploaded to internal systems or used for release notes, changelogs, or team updates.

### Benefits
- Reduces time spent drafting repetitive summaries.
- Standardizes tone across multiple writers.
- Enables rapid iteration and content reuse.
