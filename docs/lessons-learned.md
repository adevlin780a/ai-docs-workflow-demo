# Lessons Learned

### Prompt Clarity Matters
Short, vague prompts produce inconsistent results. Detailed, role-based prompts yield far better summaries.

### Review Is Essential
Even the best AI outputs need human review for factual correctness, tone, and context.

### AI Works Best as a Partner
The optimal workflow isn’t “AI vs. writer” but “AI assists writer.” The writer sets context and verifies quality.

### Iteration Improves Quality
Revising prompts, providing examples, and testing different models greatly improve output reliability.
